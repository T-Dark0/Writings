# A Story of Gods and Mortals
I occasionally like to theorize on which narrative constraints would be necessary to make a story work. ~~It's how I lie to myself and pretend I'll ever actually write that story~~. A while ago, I started to think about how one could portray a story wherein the primary characters are divine beings—gods.

Now, plenty of such stories have been written, with one of them arguably being the greatest bestseller in human history. However, most of those stories appear to invoke entirely different tropes from the stories where gods are secondary characters, or even vague background entities. An obvious example would be the Divine Gift trope: our hero(es) goes to The Holy Place, and finds or obtains The Holy Plot-Advancing Item Or Power, either put there by The Gods ages ago, or made recently for use by this specific hero. This is a near-universal trope, so much so that it appears in Vladimir Propp's categorization. It also seems absent from stories in which the gods are the protagonists, likely because if _that_ is their entire contribution to the conflict, then they can't possibly be the good guys, can they?

Thus, what follows is an attempt at a framework that allows a great number of interesting god-centric stories to be told while also retaining as many traditional tropes about what gods do as possible. Also, this framework includes elements necessary to stories set in a multiverse of connected worlds. This is owing to the fact I consider such settings interesting, and there is basically no existing literature (that I'm aware of) on how gods would work in such a context.

# The Laws of the Divine
The framework's core is a set of regulations addressing fundamental problems that an unrestricted take on the desired setting would imply.

To that end, I shall introduce a set of restrictions on how gods may act, such that they cannot violate them:

- **Law One: Indirect Interaction**  
Gods may not directly influence the mortal world beyond the power level of a weak mortal. This is why they choose champions: they can't do the deed themselves. Note that weak doesn't mean stupid: a god cannot become a ruler, (including, ironically, a cult leader), but they _can_ appear as a character giving quality advice to one. In particular, their power level is limited to that of a below-average mortal, taking the average of mortals with the same category of abilities as the god (i.e. ignoring non-mages to determine a god's magical potential). It should also be noted the dead are not exempt from Rule One: a god cannot actually claim one's soul for themselves.

- **Law Two: Limited Support**  
A god that chooses a champion would have no inherent reason not to shower them with the entire Armory Of Heaven. Thus, Law Two states that deities may only support their champions to a certain limit. Tentatively speaking, a good first guess for a limit would be that a god may empower mortals no more than they could have at the end of their Quest To Ascension, but without the need for resources to create such boosts. Note that this only applies to interactions with mortals: interactions between gods are not limited.

- **Law Three: Quest To Ascension**  
Mortals can become gods. The process to do so requires achieving an extremely high level in a skill of their choosing, and then performing some kind of "confirmation" step, which can be delayed or never performed. It should be noted that the selected skill or skills matter, as they effectively cap the god's ability to support a cause in the mortal world as stated by Law Two. Moreover, ascension is a personal process: While a mage can leave behind a spellbook containing all the magic they studied to achieve divinity, the process of researching from such a spellbook would either be no easier than creating it in the first place or be insufficient for ascension.

- **Law Four: No Subversion**   
If mortals can travel between worlds, then surely so can gods. This implies that no politically stable environment can exist, as even if one did form, a foreign deity could come and begin to agitate a few key people against it, before empowering them as allowed by Law One. Thus, Law Four disallows gods from initiating a subversion of the status quo: no ideas may be brought to an environment by a god that were not already, even if in a tiny amount, part of that environment. A divine being may convince a lone individual to overthrow the kingdom and make themselves emperor, but only if the invididual already wanted this, on some level.

- **Law Five: The War In Heaven**   
Of course, if gods can champion the causes of mortals, then surely different ones will not agree on which causes to be championed, leading to divine beings fighting each other. To maintain a playing field where the actions of mortals are what matters the most, a war between gods cannot be overly conclusive. In particular, Law Five stipulates that gods may only fight each other if their champions are fighting each other, though the nature of the conflict need not match—a brutal melee among mortals may be matched by a diplomatic discussion in heaven. Without a matching conflict of mortals, gods lack the ability to influence each other without consent, or to force consent out of the other party, even diplomatically.

# Interpretation and Open questions
The Laws of the Divine leave open a number of interesting questions and philosophical debates, both of which would make for interesting territory to explore in a story.

- What _are_ these laws, in a metaphysical sense. Is there a greater god enforcing them? Are they just how things work? Were they made at some point in the past? Is it physically possible to unmake them, or to be released from them?
Are gods unable to violate them, or unable to want to violate them? Would they even be willing to violate them? 

- Is ascension even desirable? Gods may wield immense power to steer the cosmos, and infinite time to do so, but only mortals can actually perform the steering. Can gods choose to end themselves? If not, would their immortality be eventually seen as an inevitable curse? Alternatively or additionally, would there eventually just be too many gods to get anything done? Can a god's maximum level of interaction with the mortal world be increased after ascension?

- Can mortals be brought into the lairs of gods? Can they stay permanently? Is doing so a process akin to ascension in some capacity?

- Are gods above morality? Are they considered to be so in-universe, at least by some parties? Are gods the source of mortality, (something is Good because God said so), or followers of it (God is like that because they follow Good)? If the latter, is morality connected to the cause of laws of the divine?

- How does divine power translate across universes? A god that can move mountains would be immensely powerful in most medieval-ish settings, but would be politely laughed at by a spacer society that terraforms planets on a daily basis. Does power scale according to the environment?

- Are gods bound by the laws of the world they exist in, thus ruling out anything relying on relativity in a world where Newtonian physics is correct? Are gods bound by the laws of their homeworld? Of any world?
Are gods bound by the laws of _logic_ (can a god make it so that 2 + 2 = 3?)

- Do gods take domains? Is a God Of Law like that because they are intrinsically tied to law, or because they choose to focus on that? Can domains be changed? If so, is it difficult, or as easy as changing a mask?
