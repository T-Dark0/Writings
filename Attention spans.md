# The decline of Attention Spans, or why this is fine and we should focus on something slightly different

## **The Cube**

I want you to participate in a simple though experiment: picture a society, let's call its members Cubers. It is identical to the society your parents grew up in, except for one thing: it makes use of _The Cube_.
The Cube is a featureless white cube. It insulates as much noise as it can without causing people inside it to go insane. Inside it you can find everything you need to survive, built to be as repetitive as possible. For example, Food is dropped at consistent intervals in small pellets that land perfectly silently thanks to an air cushion. Water simply fills a waterhole, likewise at consistent intervals. The Cube, ultimately, is a Chamber of Ultimate Boredom. It is built to be as devoid of stimuli as possible without counting as sensory deprivation. In an ideal construction, a person who is about to enter The Cube can know absolutely everything that is going to happen, precise to the second, for the entire duration of their stay.
The Cubers expect people to enter the cube every month, staying in it for one week. There are enough instances of The Cube for everyone to do this independently, alone. Only every sixth and seventh month are people exempt from this. Otherwise, if you refuse to enter The Cube you will be seen as a failure. You will be seen as someone who is wasting their life. If you're under someone else's legal responsibility (maybe you're a child?), then it is their duty to force you into the cube. Should they not so, they too are failures, and some people would go as far as to say your guardians should be considered unfit for the task.

As ever in human societies, there is currently a new generation of young Cubers out there. They look at The Cube much like you would: in _abject horror_: Who in their right mind would ever consider this thing a good idea‽ Who would ever _construct_ it‽ The adults, on the other hand, witness this with abject horror of their own. Every generation in remembered history has gone into The Cube. The Cube has taught them valuable lessons, such as patience. Their children, at this rate, will be incapable of going to get an ID card, an activity that requires travelling to a centralized location and waiting there in small individual rooms for an average three days. This is _nothing_, the adults say. This is barely even a wait. It is disastrous that the children can't deal with it, that **the children have no attention span**.

## Attentiveness in a post-Cuber-thought-experiment society

Now, let us abandon Cuber society and return to our world. Would you believe the children of the Cubers to be right, or would you rather side with the adults? I'm sure I can expect your reply to be "the children are obviously right, duh". If that is the case, how do you rationalize your belief that it is unacceptable for children to have attention spans too short for school?
Think about it. The Cube takes away 1/4th of their time, 5 time periods out of 7. School does the same, it's just that instead of 1 week per month the ratio is achieved by taking 6 hours out of a day. School is, likewise, extremely boring to the majority of children. And of course, children that don't go to school are not exactly considered cool for rebelling against an insane system.

I don't want to argue that the concept of schooling is bad. Quite the opposite, it holds great value. I wish to make a much more general point, focusing on the current state of our schooling system as just a particularly representative example: If the youth of our world has increasingly shorter attention spans, is it _really_ a problem? Or does the problem lie in our unwillingness and/or inability to change the status quo to better fit their needs?
There does, of course, need to be a minimal baseline: Under a certain length, attention spans are just insufficient. However, lowering the current socially acceptable minimum by a bit would not bring us to such a threshold, and is ultimately desirable anyway. 

## Why do we go out of our way to remove distractions so much?

The _removal of distractions_ is a phenomenon so universal you may never have thought to question it. A student in a class is not allowed to listen to music, no matter how good their grades are, even if they are able to respond to the professor promptly if asked. A young person at a social gathering may be reprimanded for using their phone, even if they are using it to show something to another person, thus engaging in social interaction. These and many more are common events, but... why are they?
Who _cares_ if the student is listening to music, as long as they can carry out their studently duties succesfully? Why should the youth be reprimanded for showing funny pictures to their friend while waiting for food at a restaurant? In which ways is either of these thing harming anyone?
Oftentimes, removing distractions is unnecessary, or even actively harmful: Certain forms of neurodivergence actively _require_ more stimulation: of course a classroom is a living hell to the ADHD student. But if some people need more stimulation, why is it so shocking that perhaps other people may be helped by its presence, even if they could do without?

Of course, care should be taken to recognise distractions that _are_ harmful: The student who listens to music in class and is thus rendered unable to learn effectively should probably stop listening to music in class. And of course, the person that grows addicted, to the point of their life being negatively impacted, to the content feed of social media should not ne considered to be doing just fine. Even in these cases, though, I feel I should point out that maybe the best course of action would be finding a less problematic distraction, or curing the root problem that addiction came from, if there is one.

## Why are we blaming the inattentive for being that way?

Why are we even blaming the loss of attention spans on the youth? Is it their fault they believe books are boring, or is it the fault of the system that taught them to associate books with the Room Of Six Boring Hours A Day, where teachers use them to attempt to cram uninteresting facts into the student's mind? Is it their fault that social media provides a much greater form of engagement? 
In fact, why are we blaming _anyone_? How is it a problem for a person, of any age, to need more distraction than another person, if they always have the means to procure this distraction with them and it does not negatively impact their life?

Of course, a simple response could be that society requires a certain baseline of attention span, and they are failing to meet it. This is perhaps true, but as I pointed out above, need not be. Maybe we should view attentiveness in a similar lens to eyesight: as a problem that can be accepted and corrected with simple tools and/or patterns of behaviour. Maybe we should draw inspiration from the [Social Model Of Disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability) and view the issue as a problem to be fixed _with society_, especially since it appears many fixes would be as simple as being tolerant of coping mechanisms for boredom.

### "But some things do need attention spans"

There will forever be activities that demand long attention spans: I would not want my heart surgeon to get bored halfway through the process, while my heart is cut open. However, even now, we don't exactly go around telling children to put away their phone because else they'll not be good surgeons, do we? 
More generally, we should _inform_ children that long attention spans is required for certain activities, and thus encourage and help them to grow theirs should they wish to pursue these tasks.

(On a related note, maybe it would even be a good idea to establish programs to help _all_ children grow their attention spans. I do believe failing to do so would not cause significant damage, but being able to focus on one task for longer can't really hurt. Perhaps if we kindly told our kids that it's cool to be able to focus for longer, and helped them come up with better mechanisms to do just that, rather than reprimanding them for failing to do this on their own, we would have better results)

### "The cube is a terrible metaphor for school"

It is certainly more extreme, but this is a common definining feature of metaphors: few writers say "faster than the lightning" to describe something that actually does move faster than lightning. 
The Cube, however, is hardly inaccurate. Certainly, school isn't just a seemingly useless featureless white cube. It serves a valuable purpose (or at least it should, scientific studies don't seem to claim it does it very well[1][2]). However, seen from the perspective of the young student, the very perspective whose attention span most complaints focus on, it isn't significantly different. We can tell ourselves students ought to enjoy school as much as we want, but that won't change the fact they don't. We can try to say it's ok for them not to and they need to deal wiht it, but if we do this, aren't we ultimately saying that education justifies the construction of The Cube?

## TL;DR

We as a society are remarkably quick to demand higher attention spans and cry catastrophe when we witness our youth not clearing the bar. But perhaps we should consider whether the presence of the bar itself makes sense, or if it does, whether its position should be adjusted to better match what is actually required in reality.
